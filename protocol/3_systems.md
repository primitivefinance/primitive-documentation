# Systems

## Applications

The combination of primitives and extensions creates new systems.

With all these parts, such as the pool, oracle, and the base primitive the Prime, we have a more complex system that was designed to meet a goal.

In this case, the first goal was to have a pool that sells short a Prime put option.

This pool is an application of the Primitive protocol that uses a smart token and the available extensions to accomplish a larger goal. Pools, or even other tokens, can design around the specification of the Prime to create new products, and we expect teams to do this.

**That is why we are here to help.** If you have a suggestion, request, or question you can join the protocol's developers and users in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzRwJ4K).
