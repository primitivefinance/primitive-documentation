# Getting Started

Primitive's code is open-source and is accessible on [Github](https://github.com/primitivefinance).

We actively discuss development on the Primitive protocol in the #development channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzRwJ4K).

## Overview

The protocol's design is rooted in simplicity, strength, and security. We keep the basic logic
separate from the complex logic, and favor efficient simple systems.

## Primitives and Extensions

The primitives we design serve as the seed to larger systems. These are contracts that are designed to be used in other
systems as building blocks and mediums to exchange value.

We also build extension contracts to easily interact with the primitives. For example, our Prime Trader
contract makes it easy for regular users to interact with the Prime options rather than go through an entity like
a pool.

The combination of primitives + extensions act as new tools to a larger application layer that will
be built using the Primitive protocol.
