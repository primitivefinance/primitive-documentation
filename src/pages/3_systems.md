## Applications

The combination of primitives and extensions creates new systems.

With all these parts, such as the pool, oracle, and the base primitive the Prime, we have a more complex system that was designed to fill a goal.

In this case, the first goal was to have a pool that sells short a Prime put option.

This pool is what we call an "application" of the Primitive protocol which uses a primitive like the Prime token and the available extensions to accomplish a larger goal. Pools or even other tokens can design around the specification of the Prime to create new products, and we expect teams to do this.

**Thats why we are here to help.** If you have a suggestion, request, or question you can join the protocol's developers and users in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzRwJ4K).
