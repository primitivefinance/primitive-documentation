# Primitive

Primitive is a decentralized protocol for options.

This page needs to be updated.





**What are the risks of using Primitive?**

The smart contracts of the Primtive Protocol cannot be proven to be 100% secure, and thus any funds locked in the protocol have the potential to be lost entirely.

### Resources

Primitive's code is open-source and is accessible on [Github](https://github.com/primitivefinance).

We actively discuss development on the Primitive protocol in the \#development channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzRwJ4K).
